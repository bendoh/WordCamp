			Last, but not least.
			
			To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
			I strongly encourage to minify it first.
			
			In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
			
			You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
			And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
			because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
			Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
